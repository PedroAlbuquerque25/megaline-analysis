## 🇺🇸 Project Overview
As a **Data Analyst** for **Megaline**, a major telecom operator, I analyzed the profitability of two prepaid plans — **Surf** and **Ultimate**.  
The goal was to identify user consumption patterns across **500 customers** and determine which plan generates higher revenue, supporting **data-driven marketing decisions**.

This project was developed as part of the **TripleTen Data Science curriculum**.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
- Compare the revenue generated by two prepaid plans
- Understand customer usage behavior
- Support strategic allocation of the marketing budget
- Validate findings using statistical hypothesis testing

---

## 📊 Business Insights & Recommendations

### 💰 Revenue Drivers
Users subscribed to the **Surf** plan frequently exceed their data limits, generating significant additional revenue through overage fees. Despite having a lower base price, Surf proves to be **highly profitable**.

### 📶 Usage Patterns
Data consumption is the main differentiator between plans. A large portion of Surf users consistently purchases extra gigabytes, indicating demand for a **mid-tier plan**.

### 📍 Regional Analysis
No statistically significant difference was found between users in the **NY–NJ area** and other regions, suggesting consistent behavior across markets.

### 📌 Recommendation
Megaline should continue promoting the **Surf** plan while considering the development of a **mid-tier data plan** to better capture users who frequently exceed their limits.

---

## 📐 Statistical Validation
- Applied **Independent Samples T-Tests (Welch’s t-test)**
- Confirmed that the difference in average revenue between Surf and Ultimate plans is **statistically significant (p < 0.05)**
- Ensured assumptions were met through exploratory analysis and distribution visualization

---

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### 🔄 Data Processing & ETL
- Processed **five relational datasets** (calls, internet, messages, plans, users)
- Handled missing values and corrected data types
- Converted date columns and optimized memory usage

### 🧮 Business Logic
- Individual calls rounded up to the nearest minute
- Monthly data usage rounded up to the next gigabyte

### 📊 Analysis & Visualization
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Revenue distributions using histograms and boxplots
- Hypothesis testing with `scipy.stats`
